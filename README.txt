To view homework:
- open index.html in browser
  -- Displays Carousel with large Main images
  -- Displays thumbnail images
  -- Hover over main image to see prev/next navigation arrows
  -- Navigation arrows will navigate to beginning and end of Carousel main images
  -- To enable navigation with more than 5 images, uncomment lines 46-50 and 67
  -- Supports mobile, tablet, and desktop
  -- Cross-browser tested in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox



To run tests:
- open SpecRunner.html in browser
  -- Tests major Carousel functionality
  -- Doesn't test thumbnail navigation (prev/next buttons to navigate thumbnail images if there are more than 5 thumbnails)
